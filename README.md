# MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF BLOOD GLUCOSE REGULATION IN TYPE II DIABETIC PATIENTS in MATLAB

# Abstract

Diabetes mellitus is one of the deadliest diseases affecting millions of people worldwide. Due
to ethical issues, physiological restrictions and high expenses of human experimentation, math-
ematical modelling is a popular alternative approach in obtaining reliable information on a
disease in a safe and cost effective way.
In this thesis, we modified and expanded two existing model – Bergman’s minimal model and
Sorensen model. While Bergman model developed using simplistic approach using minimal
number of ordinary differential equations, on the contrary, Sorensen model was quite large and
complex in nature containing detailed physiological behaviour. Modifications were done in
both the model to simulate the model for fitting the real world data. The Bergman’s minimal
model of glucose and insulin plasma levels is commonly used to analyse the results of glucose
tolerance tests in humans. We present the modified minimal model with plasma insulin com-
partment under the assumption that if the plasma glucose compartment drops below the basal
glucose levels, the rate of insulin entering the plasma glucose compartment is zero. Insulin is
cleared from the plasma insulin compartment at a rate proportional to the amount of insulin in
the plasma insulin compartment.
The original Sorensen model considers the interactions of glucose, insulin and glucagon on
regulating the blood sugar. I have expanded the model by eliminating the main drawback of
the original model which was its limitation on the route of glucose entrance to the body only
to the intravenous glucose injection. I have added a model of glucose absorption in the gas-
trointestinal tract and incorporated the stimulatory hormonal effects of incretins on pancreatic
insulin secretion followed by oral glucose intake. The parameters of the expanded model are
estimated and the results of the model are validated using available clinical data sets taken from
diabetic and healthy subjects. The estimation of model parameters is accomplished through
solving nonlinear optimization problems.
